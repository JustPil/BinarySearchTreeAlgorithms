# BinarySearchTreeAlgorithms
Summary

Binary Search Tree ADT that supports addition, removal, and searching of nodes, various traversal algorithms, and a balancing algorithm.

Design

Implemented a balancing algorithm, saving nodes "in order" to an array and iteratively accessing middle indices with respect to a changing start and end array index for balancing branches.

Designed iterative Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Levelorder tree traversal algorithms using Stack and Queue.

Additional methods include identifying the minumum and maximum nodes, returning the total number of leaf nodes, returning the height of the tree, and others.
