# BinarySearchTreeAlgorithms
Summary

Binary Search Tree ADT that supports addition and removal of nodes, searching for nodes, various traversal algorithms, and a balancing algorithm.

Design

Implemented a balancing algorithm, saving nodes to an array and recursively accessing middle indices for balancing.

Designed iterative Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Levelorder tree traversal algorithms using Stack and Queue.

Additional methods include identifying the minumum and maximum nodes, returning the total number of leaf nodes, returning the height of the tree, and others.
